#### Description:
This game is designed for Harvard CS50P's final project. It is a multiple-choice quiz game.

To run the program 'python project.py' must be entered within the project directory. The game will then begin with a greeting. The player is given a guideline which includes how to check the game rules, check the high scores, selecting difficulty and returning to the menu.

There will be 10 film or TV related questions each game. Every correct answer gives you 10 points, every wrong answer costs you 5 points. If The player doesn't want to answer a question, they can opt to pass. In that case this will be accepted as a wrong answer. The current score and the question number are displayed during the gameplay.

Scores will be added in a csv file after every game which includes the player name and the difficulty level.
